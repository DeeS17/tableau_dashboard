# tableau_dashboard
In this project, I created a dashboard made using Tableau. This dashboard is helpful for analyzing trending videos on Youtube based on category, country, and time. This dashboard is intended to assist the marketing team in creating exciting content.

In the repository, there is also a presentation that explains each part of the dashboard.

The image below is an example of the display from the dashboard:
